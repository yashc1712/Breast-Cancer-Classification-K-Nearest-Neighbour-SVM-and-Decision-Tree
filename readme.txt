Breast Cancer Classification with K-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machine
This project implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to predict whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant based on various features extracted from diagnostic images. The classifier is trained on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset, which contains measurements from digitized images of breast mass samples.

Overview
The k_nearest_neigbour.py script included in this repository demonstrates the implementation of a KNN classifier using scikit-learn. It loads the breast cancer dataset, splits it into training and testing sets, and trains the classifier to predict tumor labels. The accuracy score of the classifier on the test set is printed to evaluate its performance.

Requirements
Python 3.x
NumPy
scikit-learn

Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/yashc1712/K-Nearest-Neighbour.github

Run the script

Check the accuracy score printed in the terminal to evaluate the performance of the classifier.

Results
The script will output the accuracy score of the KNN classifier on the test data, indicating its effectiveness in classifying breast tumors as benign or malignant.
