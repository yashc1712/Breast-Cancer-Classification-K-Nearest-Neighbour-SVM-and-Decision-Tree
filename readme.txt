Breast Cancer Classification with K-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machine and Decision Tree
This project implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier, Support Vector Machine and Decision Tree to predict whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant based on various features extracted from diagnostic images. The classifier is trained on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset, which contains measurements from digitized images of breast mass samples.

Requirements
Python 3.x
NumPy
scikit-learn

Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/yashc1712/K-Nearest-Neighbour.github

Run the script

Check the accuracy score printed in the terminal to evaluate the performance of the classifier.

Results
The script will output the accuracy score of the KNN classifier on the test data, indicating its effectiveness in classifying breast tumors as benign or malignant.
